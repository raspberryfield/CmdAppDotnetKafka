* Must have a local Kafka instance/cluster running, or availeble on network..
..I'm running Hyper-V, with one image Ubuntu server with Kafka installed..

* https://github.com/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-dotnet
* https://docs.confluent.io/current/clients/dotnet.html

* Install nuget package. PM> Install-Package Confluent.Kafka

Problems:
* could not resolve name, https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/172218/microsoft-tcp-ip-host-name-resolution-order
>The error message was that ubuntuserver01 could not been resolved.
* I added one row to C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
172.17.209.219 ubuntuserver01
*That line fixed the problem.
